# The plugin manifest

Every plugin ships an `assets/manifest.json`. It is how moss knows who your
plugin is, what the user gets by installing it, and what the user is trusting it
with.

This is the reference for the manifest as moss reads it **today**. The
`capabilities` field is being replaced by a `contributes`-based vocabulary — see
[Coming changes](#coming-changes) before designing around it.

## A minimal manifest

```json
{
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "What the user gets",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "entry": "main.bundle.js",
  "capabilities": ["deploy"],
  "global_name": "MyPlugin",
  "icon": "icon.svg",
  "preview": true
}
```

`name` must match the plugin's directory name. `entry` is the bundle filename
inside `dist/` — always `main.bundle.js` in practice. `global_name` is the IIFE
global your bundler produces; moss looks the plugin object up under that name.

New plugins should ship `"preview": true`. A preview plugin is offered only to
users who have turned on preview features, which is where you want to be until
the plugin is polished. Release zips are immutable, so adding the field after
your first publish costs a version bump.

## Identity and presentation

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | **Required.** Identifier; matches the directory name |
| `version` | string | **Required.** Semver |
| `entry` | string | **Required.** Bundle filename |
| `description` | string | Shown in the catalog |
| `author` | string | Shown in the catalog |
| `display_name` | string | Title for the plugin's settings section |
| `icon` | string | Filename in `assets/`; falls back to `icon.svg`, `icon.png`, `logo.svg`, `logo.png` |
| `global_name` | string | IIFE global name; defaults to PascalCase name + `Plugin` |
| `repository`, `homepage` | string | Display and provenance only |
| `min_moss_version` | string | Semver floor. Note: not currently enforced at load |
| `preview` | boolean | Hidden from the catalog unless the user enables preview features |

## What the plugin does

`capabilities` lists the hooks your plugin implements; each name maps to an
exported function of the same name.

| Capability | Hook | What the user sees |
|---|---|---|
| `deploy` | `deploy(ctx)` | a row in the deploy-target dropdown |
| `syndicate` | `syndicate(ctx)` | a channel that publishes after a deploy |
| `process` | `process(ctx)` | nothing directly — runs at scan time |
| `login` | `login()` | a connection row in the plugin's settings |

Deploy plugins may also export `configure_domain(ctx)` to handle custom-domain
setup (DNS records, verification). It is an optional hook, not a capability.

Two capability names still parsed by moss — `generate` and `enhance` — are being
removed. Nothing has ever shipped using them; do not write new plugins against
them.

### `contributes`

Declarative additions moss acts on without running your code:

```json
"contributes": {
  "frontmatter": [ ... ],
  "embed_renderers": [ ... ],
  "jobs": { "syndicate": { "verb": "Syndicated", "noun": "posts" } }
}
```

`frontmatter` adds schema fields the editor validates and completes.
`embed_renderers` registers renderers for embed syntax. `jobs` supplies the
words moss uses when it reports your hook's progress — moss owns the pixels, you
supply the verb and noun.

## Configuration

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `config` | object | Default values |
| `config_schema` | object | Field name → `"string"`, `"boolean"`, `"number"`, `"array"`, `"string[]"` |
| `config_labels` | object | Field name → label in settings |
| `config_descriptions` | object | Field name → help text |
| `config_placeholders` | object | Field name → input placeholder |
| `config_verify` | object | Field name → endpoint probe spec; settings shows "Server unreachable" on failure |

At runtime, values merge in this order: `config.json` > `config.toml` >
manifest defaults (see [runtime-environment.md](runtime-environment.md)).

**Config is for the user's settings, not your plugin's bookkeeping.** State your
plugin maintains for itself (sequence numbers, draft ids, caches) belongs in
plugin-private storage — `readPluginFile` / `writePluginFile` — where the user
won't edit it by hand.

## What the user is trusting

Keep this section as short as your plugin allows. moss gates only what protects
the user's identity, another plugin's isolation, or the machine; everything else
is yours to do without asking.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `requires` | string[] | Host grants. Today: `"execute_binary"` (run native processes). Absent or unlisted = refused, fail-closed |
| `domain` | string | The domain whose cookies you may read and write |
| `domains` | string[] | Every domain you operate on (e.g. production + staging), so a force-fresh login clears all of them |
| `requires_stack` | boolean | Needs a machine-wide companion install on first install |

Using the keystore is **not** a gated capability: you only ever sign with your
own scoped key, so it costs nobody else anything.

## Two things worth knowing before you write a hook

**A deploy hook must work without a UI.** Deploys will eventually run from the
CLI and from headless hosts with no action panel. Open a panel for first-run
setup if you like, but never let a successful publish depend on one existing.

**Not every Tauri command is reachable.** Plugins run in QuickJS behind a fixed
list of host functions. If you reach past the SDK with a raw `invoke()` for a
command that isn't on that list, it fails on every version of moss — bumping
`min_moss_version` will not help. Use the SDK; if something you need is missing,
open an issue.

## Coming changes

moss is replacing `capabilities` with declarations of what the user gains.
The two replacements are **already accepted** — a manifest can use either
vocabulary today, and moss reads both:

```json
"contributes": {
  "deploy_target": { "display_name": "IPFS" }
}
```

```json
"contributes": {
  "channel": {
    "display_name": "Matters",
    "requires_login": true,
    "imports": true
  }
}
```

`contributes.deploy_target` replaces the `deploy` capability.
`contributes.channel` replaces `syndicate`, `login` and `import`: syndication is
what a channel *is*, so it needs no flag, and the two flags say whether the user
has to connect an account first and whether their existing posts can be pulled
back into the folder.

Still to come: `process` disappears from the manifest entirely — which hooks
your plugin exports will be read from your code at install time rather than
declared. `capabilities` keeps working for at least a release after that, so
there is no version where you must have migrated.

The rationale is in the moss repository as ADR-054: a manifest should say what
the user is choosing, and anything that merely restates what the code already
says will drift from it.
